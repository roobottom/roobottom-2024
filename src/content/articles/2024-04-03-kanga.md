summary: 'I built some documentation for my design system.'

Back in the old days of the internet, Brad Frost wrote an article, "[Atomic Web Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)," in which he gives name to the concept of building webpages from reusable elements. Since then, design systems that start by defining base elements and successively add complexity have become ubiquitous. 

I built this site by following the "atomic" philosophy. Recently, though, I've found it tricky to make minor updates. My site uses Nunjucks and Less — and I'd built in *extensibility* in my components so they could be used in any context. However, my hygiene standards slipped with successive updates, resulting in some components tightly coupled to their context. Worse still, I couldn't remember how to use the various options I'd built into my Nunjucks Macros.

This site desperately needed a spring clean.

## My solution: Write stuff down
Documenting stuff is a critical design skill. In my day job, I do this *all the freaking time*. 90% of what I do is communicating to others. But I've never done this with my website. 

{% figure {
url: '/assets/images/kanga.jpg',
caption: 'Kanga is the name of my design system; it’s also the name of my design system’s mascot.',
classes: 'shadow'
} %}

So, I created documentation for my patterns and components, which I'm nominally calling a *design system*, named "Kanga" for (hopefully) obvious reasons.

Documenting the building blocks that form this site also allowed me to rationalise my components.

## Building a design system with Nunjcuks and Eleventy
I use [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as the templating language on this site. There are, of course, other options, but I find template inheritance and macro functionality lend themselves to "atomic" design structures.

Similarly, Nunjucks encourages *layouts* and *includes* (aka components) to spit code into separate concerns. 

The [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) inspired me when deciding how to document my system's elements. I like their use of standalone examples. Following this pattern forced me to ensure all my components are context agnostic.

I build a [component to show standalone examples](/kanga/components/example/) in an `iframe`. The component also extracts the code if it's one of the supported filetypes (currently Nunjucks and Markdown), strips out any frontmatter and renders it in a `details` element.
