We’d been hankering to see **SOHN** for a while, ever since I’d played his first album, *Tremors*, almost to death last summer. So when his second album, *Rennen*, was released earlier this year it meant an album tour was sure to follow.

So last week Katie and I braved a journey on Southern Rail up to the old Fridge Club (now The Electric) in Brixton: A club _slightly_ too small to accommodate a sold-out **SOHN** crowed. Katie and I tucked ourselves in neatly at the back.

The smoke machines belched with great gusto as **SOHN** took the stage. Seated behind a huge synth, he immediately launched into *Tremmors*, his powerful, pitch-perfect voice silencing even the most persistent talker.

He seemed to delight in giving each song some kind of embellishment: Whether that be an extended middle-eight or noodling around at the end, it was there in every song. It was mesmerising. I love live music, mainly for the sense of shared-experience. Everyone was swept along on the wave of **SOHN**’s synths, it put me in mind of a shared religious experience, everyone in enraptured ensemble.

I was also massively impressed by the beautiful set design: An arrangement of parallel strip-lights that changed colour and pulsed on and off in step with the music. They were the perfect focal point as **SOHN** plied his wares on stage.

Since a small person came to live in our house, our opportunity for evenings out has been severely limited. It’s a rare thing when the stars align to allow us to have a night away from home without _Roo_, so we have to get it right when we do. We defiantly got it right with **SOHN**. 10/10.
