My mind is a high-walled garden; beyond is a dark, unknowable void. A constant stream of thoughts and feelings is thrown over the wall into my garden. My entire universe is in that one small patch of land. 

I don't get to choose what appears in my garden or how much my attention is drawn to the things that occur. Some arrive unnoticed, most are studied for seconds and then discarded, and some are repeated and expanded again and again.

Most of the time, I don't pay attention to my garden. It remains unnoticed in my head. Sometimes, though, I'll suddenly find myself in the garden. It looks well-kept at first, but the more time I spend there, the more I notice how messy it is. It makes me wonder: where do my thoughts and feelings come from? Where is my ability to make a choice? If ideas are thrown in over the wall, then choices are too.
