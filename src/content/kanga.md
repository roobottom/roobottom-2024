"Kanga" is my design system; The various building blocks I use to create this site.

This documentation is primarily here for me to use as a memory aid when developing new features. Of course, you are free to browse around, too.

My website uses [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and [Less](https://lesscss.org/), so the code examples are written for those technologies.
