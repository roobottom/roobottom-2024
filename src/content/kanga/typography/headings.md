title: Headings
---
All headings are styled by default by this site's CSS, unless an overide class is applied.

All pages _should_ have at least an `h1`, the use heading-levels from the stack to support the sementic meaning of the page.

Headings use sizes from the [type scale](/kanga/typography-type-scale/).
