title: Grid
---
Grids are pretty simple, they only kick-in at the `max` breakpoint. There's 12 available columns, each successive column is stacked next to the other.

You don't need to fill all the available column slots.

Span multiple columns with the class `grid-column--xN` where `N` is a number from 1 to 12.
