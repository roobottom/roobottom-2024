title: Lists

HTML lists are used extensively throughout this site. This is unsurprising as many pages contain _lists_ of things, like diary posts or articles.

## Standard lists

You can apply the class `list` to any `ul` or `ol` element to create a nicely styled collection like this:

{% example '/kanga/example/structure/list-standard', '300' %}

## Grid lists

You can apply the class `list list--grid` to any `ul` or `ol` element to create a nicely styled collection. It's usually used with the [Card component](/kanga/components/card/), like this:

{% example '/kanga/example/structure/list-grid', '600' %}
