title: Kidâ€™s Age
---
In my diary, I show how old my kids were at the time of each post.

By passing a date of birth, post date, kid's name and an emoji, this component will display:

* How old the child is at the time of this post,
* or, how long it will be before they're born,
* or, that they were recently born (within the last month), and show a little emoji that depicts our family.
