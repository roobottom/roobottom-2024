introduction: Everything you never wanted to know about me.

Hello, I'm Jon Roobottom, a human man with a penchant for building websites. Born and bred in [Brownhills](/articles/2022-05-16-walking-around-brownhills/), in the industrial midlands, I now live on the south coast (near Brighton) with my wife and two children.

I'm one of those annoying [MAMIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamil )s you see around town, messing about on bikes, trying to recapture their youth. I like to run, cycle and make grunting noises in the gym.

## Work
For the past five years, I've worked on public digital services with clients like HMRC, The Home Office, DLUHC, GCHQ, and GDS, first through my agency [Roodesign](https://roodesign.co.uk/), and more recently as a Principal UX Designer at [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com/).

Previously, I've worked for various web design agencies and digital product companies. 

For more information, look at [my CV](https://cv.roobottom.com/) or peruse [my portfolio](https://roodesign.co.uk). 

## Writing
I've been writing things on this website since 2005. I write long-form [articles](/articles/) and post short [diary entries](/diary/) that are only available to friends and family.

### Article status
My articles are living documents that can grow and change over time. To track their state, I use the following status codes:

## Colophon
This website was designed in Sketch and is built with Eleventy. It's hosted on Railway using a hastily built Express-js server that does clever server-side stuff with some routes, like `/diary` and a custom `404` page.
